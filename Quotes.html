  <h1>Biblical Quotes</h1>
  <p>Today we need people who dare to question the status quo and say, "Wait a minute here. Where do you find this in the Bible?" The idea that all you have to do is to accept Christ and you are in is a great mistake. It leaves people with the impression that if they accept Christ they have no fight to fight, no warfare, no job to do and no temptations. They are just in. When you accept Christ rightly as your Lord and Savior you are in, but to be honest, you have just started to fight. People get converted and we do not tell them that they must fight all the way through to heaven because of the spirit of degeneration and the tendency to deteriorate. They must fight, pray through, suffer it out and live in praise and worship, because if they do not they will deteriorate. Read the history of the Christian church if you can keep your faith and keep from weeping.

<p>Lord help us all to stay on the firing line, stay with the word and you will not go wrong. We are weak but he is strong, he has given us the power of the Holy Ghost to overcome everything that comes our way. There is wonder working power in the blood of the Lamb. Trust and obey, that is the way to be happy in Jesus Christ. Amen
